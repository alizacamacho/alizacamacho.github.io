								<p>This was an extremely interesting module!! Since I have a bit of experience with music through choir, I felt I was able to connect a lot of my working knowledge with 
									this new information. Overall, I think through choir I’ve learned to listen for melodies and basslines, but beats were something completely new. When we were asked 
									to try to listen to the beat in Single Ladies, I listened to it so many times but still couldn’t find when the offbeat was. I think one thing I want to try is to 
									to really listen for the beats in music and try to replicate them.
								</p>
								<p>Additionally, basslines were something both familiar but also new. I was normally an alto or alto II (the lowest part in our women’s choir), so I sang a lot 
									of the basslines. I recall singing the “ding dongs” in the Christmas song
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_ouyECGfAo&ab_channel=VariousArtists-Topic">Carol of the Bells</a>.

								<p>Despite my familiarity with singing basslines, I found trying to create something harder. Learning about how basslines can be an arpeggio helped me understand a little more, 
									although at first what I made sounded more similar to melodies. I’ll try focusing on simplifying them and see if that helps. For now, similar to the beats, I’m going to try 
									listening for the basslines in songs and replicating them either in future works or just by humming them.

								<p>My process for creating my first little loop-tastic mix was not very methodical. I focused and fumbled my way through learning Ableton first. After finally discovering how to get sound out of the program, I was able to link up my midi and learn how to create a few simple 4 bar loops of my own. I started with a simple four-on-the-floor drum kick and found a shaker sound I liked to create a very simple beat. Then with my midi board, I recorded some chords that I thought meshed well together. I tried these chords on a couple different instruments but found I liked the synth piano best because it imitated the sound of a lead vocal.</p>
								<p>Lastly I looked through the provided loops and clips from Ableton and found an arpeggio in the key of G that fit perfectly with the chords I had already settled on. I wish it was planned, but it was very much a happy coincidence.  It felt like the loops I created myself were a little slow and simple, so this loop provided just the right amount of complexity I was looking to add. After that, I felt like the last thing missing was something to add a little energy to mix, so I found a fitting beat and added it. To my great surprise, it fit quite well and picked up the pace just as I hoped.</p>
								<p>Overall, this time round I think my approach to creating sound structure was lacking a little. I did rely on the ideas of four-on-the-floor and sticking to the four bar loops to make it a little simpler to add on to. Moving forward, I hope I can have a little more structured approach and attention to detail, such as choosing a key the loop will be in beforehand. Although this time wasn’t a conventional approach, I still enjoyed learning Ableton and playing in the DAW. It definitely gave me a new appreciation for the music I listen to.</p>
								<p>In my opinion, this form of music is most definitely a legitimate form of musical creativity and it requires quite a bit of skill. I think I’m still in the stage where I need to develop an ear and learn the technical side of things before I can fully express myself but I look forward to the time I can. I can already feel a lot of ideas formulating and even little melodies popping up in my head. With someone who has a detailed understanding of DAWs and music, I can only imagine the countless possibilities they come up with. In the end, 
									creativity is defined as “the use of imagination and original ideas”,  and I think this music definitely exhibits this. Some people might get stuck on the word “original”, and argue using an existing sample makes this process not creative. Although in all honesty there is no such thing as an original idea, we are all influenced by everything we see, hear, and experience. As well, being able to use a sample in a new combination never heard before is creative and original. Yes, I am using a beat sample and arpeggio that I didn’t create from scratch but once I have a better handle of the DAW, there’s nothing stopping me from creating an extremely similar beat years later by accident or using the beat in a way never seen before. From my perspective, the creative process is being able to actually employ the beat in an original composition of melodies, basslines, and sounds.</p>

								<p>I enjoyed this module for learning all the new vocabulary. In music, there is quite a bit of terminology I’m not familiar with, so it was helpful to apply each new term to an actual example that I could play with. For example, being able to learn that an envelope is the shape of sound changing over time then being able to play with that shape myself.</p>
								<p>As well, I enjoyed the visual comparisons such as for when we can begin to hear oscillations around 20 Hz, then this example was demonstrated with the wings of a bee. As someone who learns best visually, these examples help me add mental images to the definitions and understand better.  I think I will always remember what a low pass filter is with the image of closing a door.</p>
								<p>Lastly, I enjoyed playing with all the elements we learned about in the final playground. Especially with a keyboard it was interesting to create different sound and note combinations. It made me start to think about how I would use these elements and incorporate them into the music I make.</p>
