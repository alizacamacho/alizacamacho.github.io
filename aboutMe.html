							<p><strong>Hello! I’m Aliza </strong>|<i> uh-lisa</i> | she/they</p>
							<p>Born and raised in Bakersfield, CA, and back from four years on the east coast where I received a B.A. in Computer Science from Wellesley College. I currently work remotely as a front-end software engineer at a finance company based out of Boston and I’ve previously worked in research, design, and digital fabrication. Later in college  I took classes in design and media arts and since then I have been exploring options to combine my original computer science background with my passion for these arts. Starting the Summer of 2023, I will be pursuing a Certificate in Media Arts at Bakersfield College to expand my skill set and better find the career that best fits me.</p>
							<p>Aside from my work aspirations, I also enjoy a wide variety of pastimes from martial arts to language studies - I love exploring new cultures and arts. The pictures above are from 2017 when I studied Chinese in a three month long immersion program in Beijing. I continue to self-study Chinese and will add Japanese soon in hopes of going to Japan for future cultural immersion. I also enjoy staying active with practices like yoga, weight-lifting, and Aikido and Iaido, which are forms of martial arts I've practiced since high school.</p>
							<p>In addition to my interests in languages and martial arts, I enjoy finding new hobbies and am always happy to talk to others about their personal passions! Whether it’s ranking in Fortnite, cooking tasty meals, discussing mechanical keyboards, or exchanging web comics, I love it all. More than anything, I love connecting with people and hearing new perspectives.</p>
